merge libgtcore and libgtmatch:
-------------------------------

- replace FastaReader with SeqIterator
- move alphabet to core
- Alphabet (Stefan: ersetze alphabet.pr durch alphadef.h, Gordon: evtl. mergen
  mit Alpha)
- Encodedseq und Bioseq mergen ()
  guesprot.c

- merge Timer und measure-time.c (Ereignis, formatierter String)

view tool:
----------

- allow to specify the ``type order'' of tracks in config file
- allow to sort tracks by type and then by filename (in the order specified
  on the command line) or the other way round (one is the default, one is
  switched on by a command line option)


BitPackArray/BitPackClass:
--------------------------

- use naming conventions (e.g., bitpackarray_new instead of newBitPackArray)
