CGILua 5.1
http://keplerproject.org/cgilua

CGILua is a tool for creating dynamic Web pages and manipulating input
data from Web forms. CGILua allows the separation of logic and data
handling from the generation of pages, making it easy to develop web
applications with Lua.

One of advantages of CGILua is its abstraction of the underlying Web server.
You can develop a CGILua application for one Web server and run it on any
other Web server that supports CGILua, even if using a different launching model.

CGILua can be used with a variety of Web servers and, for each server,
with different launchers. A launcher is responsible for the interaction of
CGILua and the Web server, for example using ISAPI on IIS or mod_lua on Apache.
The reference implementation of CGILua launchers is Kepler.

CGILua is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.1. 

Installation
CGILua follows the package model for Lua 5.1, therefore it should be "installed" in your package.path. 

Version 5.1.1 [21/Nov/2007]

        * Changed the security policy for scripts. Now scripts have access to all Lua globals,
        including the debug and os packages. It is up to the application developer to choose what policy to use
        * If you are using Kepler, it is strongly suggested that you replace your previous CGILua config.lua file
        with the new one installed by Kepler and then merge the differences
        * Added the cgilua.dispatcher module
        * Added default handlers for a set of MIME types. The default handlers return only the content-type and
        conten-lenght headers for the files.
        * Added functions cgilua.splitonfirst and cgilua.splitonlast
        * Added functions cgilua.tmpfile and cgilua.tmpname
        * Changed the use of "/test" for the session temporary directory checking (bug found by Yuri Takhteyev)
        * Corrected the use of cgilua.QUERY in the session handling (bug found by Jim Madsen)
        * Better handling of "application/xml" POST content types (patch by Ignacio Burgueño)
        * Fixed Bug [#1910] - Bug in byte accounting in post.lua (found by Greg Bell)
