fold the following RNA sequence with Nussinov Algorithm:
gggaaatcc
length of RNA sequence = 9
using the following parameters:
l_min =  3
alpha(G,C) = alpha(C,G) = -3
alpha(A,U) = alpha(U,A) = -2
alpha(G,U) = alpha(U,G) = -1
all other alpha values have been set to infinity
score: -7
result:
(1,9)(2,8)(3,7)
